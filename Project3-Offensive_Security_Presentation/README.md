## Purpose of Project
In this project, we worked in groups of four completing the below reports individually while making emphasis on using teamwork and communication. 

To finalise the project in our groups we got to choose to present defensive security, offensive security, or network security presentations. My group decided on the offensive security presentation which is available below.
