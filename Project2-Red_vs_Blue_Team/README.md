## Purpose of Project

The purpose of this project was to play as the red team and the blue team and create baselines for system hardening.

We first attacked a vulnerable host using Kali Linux exploiting the system and carrying out malicious attacks. After this we used Kibana to monitor all the traffic from the attacks and set up dashboard and alerts to monitor and mitigate risks of outside attacks to the target.

This report details the outcomes of the red team and blue team engagement.
